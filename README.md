- Clean and modern interface that simplifies things enough for the layuser but with enough depth for a power user

## Contributing
You're welcome to help contribute to Knossos if you'd like! Please review our [contribution guide](https://support.modrinth.com/en/articles/8802215-contributing-to-modrinth) before attempting to contribute or make a pull request though.

## Development
To get started, install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Then, run the following commands:

```
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

Once that's done, you'll be serving knossos on `localhost:3000` with hot reloading. You can run `pnpm run build` to build for a production server and `pnpm run start` to start the server. You can also use `pnpm run lint` to find any eslint problems, and `pnpm run fix` to try automatically fixing those problems.

If you've never used Nuxt before, check out the [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxt.com/docs).
